3 available commands are upload, delete and search.
these can be used by typing the name of the command followed by a space and then your filename.
for example:

upload image.png

OR 

delete video.mp4

etc...

this code should theoretically support ALL filetypes since .BIN files are used.

NOTE: client and server apps should be in different folders with server folder having an additional folder named storage.
All .h files will go in server folder.
